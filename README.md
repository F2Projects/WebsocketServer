### Compile

The easier way to compile the plugin is with make. 
Use

	make

to compile the plugin for your system. If you use Mac OS, there are some additional operations to do. Use 

	make mac

and don't care! On Mac OS you can directly install the plugin with

	make mac_install

This feature will be implemented soon on the other operating systems.
